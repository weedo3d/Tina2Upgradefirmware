## The difference between the community version firmware and the official version firmware

The official firmware has the function of upgrading the firmware via TF card. Use the IAP function in the control menu to read the flash.wfm file on the TF card to upgrade the firmware.

The community version firmware does not support the wfm format, so it does not support firmware upgrade via TF card.


## Return to the official vesrion firmware

Use WEEDOIAP.exe to flash TINA2_Vxxx_Community_to_Official.bin in the /Release directory.
